# ü§ñ AI HR Agent ‚Äì Automating HR Workflows

AI HR Agent is a **full-stack, AI-powered Human Resources automation system** that streamlines **job posting, resume screening, interview analysis, onboarding task generation, and leave approval prediction** into a single, unified workflow.  
This project was developed as part of an MSc dissertation to explore **how effectively AI can automate end-to-end HR processes** while improving efficiency and decision-making.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Job Posting & Management** ‚Äì Admin can create, edit, and delete job openings.
- ‚úÖ **Candidate Portal** ‚Äì Candidates can submit resumes, receive interview invites, and record video interviews via webcam.
- ‚úÖ **Resume Parsing & Scoring** ‚Äì Python microservice uses NLP (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) to match resumes with job descriptions.
- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Interview Analysis** ‚Äì Processes recorded video, analyzes voice tone, keywords, and gestures to generate an interview score.
- ‚úÖ **Automated Hiring Decisions** ‚Äì Weighted decision model automatically classifies candidates as ‚ÄúHire‚Äù or ‚ÄúReject.‚Äù
